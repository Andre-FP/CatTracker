# CatTracker

Project proposed and developped by a group of 3 people for a university discipline at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The project aims to detect cats inside a house using cameras and inform the owner via cellphone. The objective is to allow the owner to know where the cat is, especially if it likes to hide when you are looking for it.

## Demonstrations Usage

Below are some pictures that show the usage of the software. With a Telegram bot, the person can send the message "/sendpic", and the system will send the last photo corresponding to the last time the cat was seen.
If the cat has not been seen for a long time, it will show a photo with the direction the cat was last seen. These behaviors can be seen in the following pictures:
